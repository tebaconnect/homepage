							<p><strong>THE INSPIRATION BEHIND THEBA CONNECT</strong><br />
								<br />Theba Connect draws its name and spirit from Thebes, the magnificent ancient capital of Egypt during the Middle and New Kingdoms—one 
								of the most advanced and influential civilizations in history.  As a center of culture, innovation, architecture, and leadership, 
								Thebes symbolized the height of human potential and societal progress. It was where great ideas were born, alliances were forged, and 
								visions for the future took form.<br />
 
								<br />At Theba Connect, we carry forward that legacy—blending the timeless inspiration of civilization-building with the urgency of modern 
								innovation, strategic thinking, and purpose-driven leadership. Like the ancient city, Theba stands as a catalyst for transformation, 
								empowering future-ready leaders, fostering meaningful connections, and designing solutions that shape a better world.<br />
								 
								<br />Theba Connect is not just a name—it’s a commitment to building what’s next, rooted in the wisdom of what came before.<br />
