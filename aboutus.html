						<strong>Theba Connect</strong> draws its name and spirit from Thebes, the magnificent ancient capital of Egypt during the Middle and New Kingdoms—one of the most advanced 
						and influential civilizations in history.  As a center of culture, innovation, architecture, and leadership, Thebes symbolized the height of human potential 
						and societal progress. It was where great ideas were born, alliances were forged, and visions for the future took form. At <strong>Theba Connect</strong>, we carry forward that legacy—blending the timeless inspiration of civilization-building with the urgency of modern innovation, strategic
